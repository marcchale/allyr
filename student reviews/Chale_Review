- Accuracy
  - Are the results accurate?
     #Market time is verified accurate. 
     #I did not verify the "functions requiring authorization." 
     
  - Is it clear how the results were computed?
    # Based on the examples provided, the functions appear to transmit requests and receieve data from the API. 

- Compilation
  - Did the analytic work? (i.e. install correctly, startup correctly)
    # Seemless install.
    # Each of the three functions I tested performed as expected.
    
  - Were errors encountered when executing code according to the documentation?
    # Documentation for each of the three functions were nicely formatted as was the README. 
    # Specifically add input arguments (and lack of input arguments) to the function documentation
    # Examples in documentation were useful.
    # add git install instructions to README
- Ease of use
  - Is it clear how to use the analytic? (i.e. is the documentation clear)
    # The three functions I tested were easy to use. Consistent with documentation.
  - Are the visualizations/plots interpretable?
    # No visualizations in the non-auth functions. None that I know of in the auth functions
    # The file structure of the git repository is clean and easy navigate however I would advocate to 
    # use the standard file structure from the course notes.

# I could not find proposal 2 in the repository so I assume full credit for accomplishing tasks. As you continue your coursework,
#you may consider incorporating some data analytics (descriptive/predictive/prescriptive analysis) to your package.
#Adding some data visualization would bring this package to the next level. 47/50, Outstanding!
