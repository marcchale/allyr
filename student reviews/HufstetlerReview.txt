- Accuracy
  - Are the results accurate?
    # Ryan you clever fellow. I am unable to verify if the functions actually work
      because I'm not going to set up an investment account.
  - Is it clear how the results were computed?
    # From the sample provided in the README.md file, it appears that all the
      functions work, given the user has an investment account.

- Compilation
  - Did the analytic work? (i.e. install correctly, startup correctly)
    # The package loads correctly and the commands work right out of the box, with
      one excpetion:
  - Were errors encountered when executing code according to the documentation?
    # The function allyr::GetMarketTimes() threw an error because I was running
      {rlang} 0.4.2, but 0.4.5 is required. One thing you may want to add though
      is a list of test functions. When I ran devtools::test(), no test infrastructure
      was detected.

- Ease of use
  - Is it clear how to use the analytic? (i.e. is the documentation clear)
    # The package seems to be really useful for people who have an Ally investment
      account. The documentation gives a list of functions and an example of each
      being executed.
  - Are the visualizations/plots interpretable?
    # There are no visualizations or plots, but the outputs are in easy to read
      tables.

Based on the rubric below, I have to assess this package as Outstanding for the following
reasons:
 - All tasks were completed as far as I can tell, I couldn't find your proposal documents
 - The README gives users a nice list of the functions they can run and the expected outputs
 - After updating {rlang}, I encountered no errors in installation or building
